   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Sysh's documentation!
================================

This is a pet project of mine to learn some software development stuff in python. This things doesn't do much since it
s sort of a whole mess of features. This documentation will attempt to make things more clear if possible.

If you plan to use this code for some reason and need help or want a feature feel free to email me at
``ledbetterte@gmail.com`` or message me on discord at ``Jill The Something#9287``. Not terribly professional, I know.
